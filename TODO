Changes to be made to Suntiger:

** rewrite st_parse to generate parse tree instead of emitting code.

*** Add support for procedures, with both call by value and call by name
(call by name should be the default).

*** Add support for arrays.

** Convert existing 'while' statement to a subset of the Algol-60
'for' expression.

* Change 'if' statements to support expressions (that is, they should
return a value). Expression-syntax 'if' may or may not be different
from statement-syntax 'if', depending on implementation pragmatics. 

* Remove or re-write built-in I/O procedures.

* Re-write options handling to use getopt or similar.

*** Change code generation functions (or classes) to allow re-targeting.
Should include a command-line switch to choose target.

** Re-write code generation to eliminate redundant data and load/store
operations.

* Add optimization stage between parsing and code gen., and peephole
optimization after code generation.
